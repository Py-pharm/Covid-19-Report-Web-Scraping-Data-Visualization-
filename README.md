# Covid-19-Report-Web-Scraping/Data-Visualization

In this project, I used the python library **BeautifulSoup** to scrape COVID-19 data from the [NCDC website](https://covid19.ncdc.gov.ng/).
The data was scraped on the 7th of August, 2022.

I further designed a dashboard with the data using PowerBI. The visualization and findings from the data is shown below:
